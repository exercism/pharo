## Running Tests

At the most basic level, Exercism is all about [the tests](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/exercises/anatomy/test-suites.md).

In Pharo, you can run tests for a single exercise by clicking on the test orb next to a class or method. 
Alternatively you can use the playground and type then evaluate:
```
MyExercismPackage suite run.
```

*Did you know: TDD was invented in Smalltalk via the introduction of the [SUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUnit) test library*
