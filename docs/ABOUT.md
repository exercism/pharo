Welcome to [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org), an environment and language that embraces creativity, exploration and fun.

It features a world that is:

- **Simple and Powerful:** No constructors, type declarations, interfaces and primitive types. Yet it's a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax that fits on a postcard! The magic is objects and messages all the way down.
- **Live and Immersive:** Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, exploring, debugging. Even in live environments, you don't need to wait to compile and deploy!
- **Amazing for Debugging:** The debugger is unlike anything you've seen before. While it lets you step through code, you can also restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!
- **Rich in History but Forward Looking:** Many concepts originated from Smalltalk: MVC, JIT compilation, Live coding, TDD, Refactoring and many more. However we are still looking ahead with moldable tools, GtSpotter, Agile Visualisation, and Pharo MetaLinks to name a few...
- **Active, Friendly, Helpful Community:** Pharo is yours, made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors on the last revision and many more constantly contributing with frameworks, libraries and advice.

Still not convinced? Smalltalk has a rich and fascinating [history](http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/), that has influenced most of todays languages and techniques in one form or another. [Learning the source](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/950145591379742727) of these ideas is the road to being a good programmer in any language.  But most of all, its just incredibly fun!
