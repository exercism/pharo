Pharo is an open source, pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

It Features:

- **Simple & powerful language:** No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.
- **Live, immersive environment:** Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!
- **Amazing debugging experience:** The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!
- **Pharo is yours:** Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing constantly with frameworks and libraries.
