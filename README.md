# Exercism Pharo Track

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/pharo.svg?branch=master)

Exercism exercises in Pharo.

## Initial Setup

The simplest way to install Pharo is is to use [zero conf](http://pharo.org/download#//*[@id="main"]/div/h2[3]) from a terminal command line.

Simply enter:
```$xslt
curl https://get.pharo.org | bash
```

Then launch Pharo and load some initial tools by typing:
```$xslt
./pharo-ui Pharo.image eval "
Metacello new 
 baseline: 'Exercism'; 
 repository: 'github://exercism/pharo:master/dev/src';
 load.
(RPackageOrganizer default packageNamed: 'Exercism') browse
"
```

If you have any TIMEOUT problems when loading the initial tools (some corporate firewalls block git access), you can add an additional command to 
the beginning of the eval script like this:
 ```
./pharo-ui Pharo.image eval "
Iceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.
Metacello new 
...
```

**NOTE:** When you exit Pharo, save your changes (left click on the Pharo Desktop, and select "Save and Quit") then you DO NOT need
to repeat the tool loading step above, and should simply type:
```$xslt
./pharo-ui Pharo.image
```

***Did you know:** When you launch Pharo, you are actually restoring an execution image snapshot - similar to a VMWare Operating System image. This
is a powerful concept, as it allows you to suspend work mid operation, possibly even when you are in the middle of debugging
something. When you relaunch Pharo, you could then continue stepping through code in the restored debugger, or even continue a refactoring step.*

## Contributing

We are keen to improve this track and show developers a different way of thinking about coding! :tada:

Please read about how to [get involved in a track](https://github.com/exercism/docs/tree/master/contributing-to-language-tracks). Be sure to read the Exercism [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We welcome pull requests of all kinds. No contribution is too small, particularly contributions that provide fixes and improvements to existing exercises. Please note that this track's exercises must conform to the Exercism-wide standards described in the [documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/tree/master/language-tracks/exercises). If you're unsure about how to make a change, then open a GitHub issue, and we'll discuss it.


## Working on the Exercises

We welcome both improvements to the existing exercises and new exercises.
A list of missing exercise can be found here: http://exercism.io/languages/pharo/todo


### Conventions

- We use [SUunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUnit) (the original xUnit libary) and no additional 3rd-party-frameworks.
- We use the parameter order `self assert: actual equals: expected)` 


### Testing

At the most basic level, Exercism is all about the tests. You can read more about how we think about test suites in [the Exercism documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/exercises/anatomy/test-suites.md).

All Pharo exercises must be compatible with SUnit.

To test a single exercise run it from the built in test runner by clicking on the test orb. Alternatively you can use the playground and evaluate:
```
MyExercismPackage suite run.
```

### Code Style

The Pharo code in this repo is meant to follow [Smalltalk with style](http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/WithStyle/SmalltalkWithStyle.pdf) .

# Opening an Issue

If you plan to make significant or breaking changes, please open an issue so we can discuss it first. If this is a discussion that is relevant to more than just the Pharo track, please open an issue in [exercism/discussions](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests should be focused on a single exercise, issue, or conceptually cohesive change. Please refer to Exercism's [pull request guidelines](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/pull-request-guidelines.md).

Please follow the coding standards for Pharo. (If there is a formatter for the track's language, add instructions for using it here.)

### Verifying Your Change

Before submitting your pull request, you'll want to verify the changes in two ways:

* Run all the tests for the Pharo exercises
* Run an Exercism-specific linter to verify the track

All the tests for Pharo exercises can be run from the top level of the repo with:

```
"TBA - this still needs to be determined, probably something like:"
Exercism suite run.
```

For the Exercism specific linting, please see [the documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/configuration/linting.md).

## Contributing a New Exercise

Please see the documentation about [adding new exercises](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/make-up-new-exercises.md).

Note that:

- Each exercise must stand on its own. Do not reference files outside the exercise directory. They will not be included when the user fetches the exercise.
- Exercises should use only the Pharo core libraries.
- Exercises must conform to the Exercism-wide standards described in [the documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/tree/master/language-tracks/exercises).
- Each exercise should have a test suite, an example solution, a template file for the real implementation and ... (anything else that needs to go with each exercise for this track). The CI build expects files to be named using the following convention: (describe the Pharo convention for naming the various files that make up an exercise).
- Please do not commit any configuration files or directories inside the exercise other than ...
- Be sure to add it to the appropriate place in the `config.json` file.


## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Pharo team for all their dedication in building a modern open source Smalltalk.
