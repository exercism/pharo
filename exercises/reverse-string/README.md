# Reverse String

Reverse a string

For example:
input: "cool"
output: "looc"

## Hint
While there is a #reversed method for Strings, can you figure out how to do this yourself with lower level character iteration or streams? To help you browse code, Pharo has a neat code finder tool. Press Shift-Enter to activate it.NOTE: We have followed the Exercism convention of calling the solution ReverseString, however a more Smalltalk name would be StringReverser.


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `reverse-string` into the `Exercism | Fetch Exercise` package menu prompt (right click on the Exercism package in the Pharo System Browser). You can also submit your solution from the same menu for any selected package. You don't normally need to use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `ReverseStringTest`, will test the functionality of `ReverseString`.
