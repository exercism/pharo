You might find Pharo dictionaries useful in completing this exercise.Pharo has several ways to construct dictionaries, including `Dictionary new: at:put:`and a literal syntax using `Association`s. An `Association` looks like `key -> value`and can be turned into a dictionary like this: `{ 'key' -> 'value' } asDictionary`.Remember that in Smalltalk, all infix operators are right-associative and that youcan browse any of the classes mentioned above live.
