Note that SpaceAge >> on:at: receives the name of an object as an argument instead of a symbol. Symbols exist in Smalltalk and a similar on:at: message could receive a first argument of e.g. #Earth. Here Earth will need to be a live object in Pharo. That object could be an instance variable on SpaceAgeTest or a global variable (see Smalltalk globals), but remember that classes are objects themselves...
