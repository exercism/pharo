In Pharo, classes are objects that can have instance and class methods, however unlike HelloWorld the tests for TwoFer have been written to call instance methods. Typically class methods are used for constructing new objects (like a contructor in other languages).While referring to methods, its useful to know that a method which has no parameters, is called a unary method, and a method taking multiple parameters, each deliniated by a word ending with a ':', is called a keyword method.There is also a third type of method, binary, which takes only 1 parameter and uses a symbol(s) for a name (typically a mathematical one like: +, -, & etc).
