The tests for this exercise (and future exercises), are prefix numbered 'test0X_'. This is not a normal convention in Pharo, however to ease the study of the language it is useful to present tests in a useful and deterministic order.For this exercise, study the 'arithmetic' method category for class Number, as well as how boolean operators are also defined as messages. Notice how "and:" and "or:" are implented in the classes True and False. You can use the context menu item "senders of..." to view how other parts of Pharo use these operators.
