# Instructions append

These kinds of problems (where an answer is dependent on a previous) one are often called recursion. There are different ways to code for recursion, it might be worth reasearching if you are not familiar with this. Pharo is well optimised for recursion, and it is a commonly used pattern.Note: in the original problem specification, the grainsCalculator is called via #square, however we have renamed this method #atSquare: which is a more Smalltalk like name, that better describes that you are asking for an answer "at a square".
