# Running Tests

Tests can be run directly from the test class. The test class is normally named after the class under test e.g.
`HelloWorld` is the class tested by `HelloWorldTest`. To run a test click the button next to any method
prefixed with `test`. The button will be colored according to the result of the last test: green for pass,
yellow for fail, and red for error.

All the tests in a class can be run by clicking the button next to the test class name. Larger groups of tests
can be run using the Test Runner tool from the world menu. `ctrl + OU` opens the Test Runner 
(`cmd + OU` for MacOS).
